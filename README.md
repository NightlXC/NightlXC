**NightlXC/NightlXC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my capstone project EchoLearn
a website that uses spaced repetition to help users retain their knowledge for the long term. I have been focusing on the frontend development of the website. Additionally, I created a simple mobile app for our platform, allowing users to quickly access and study on the go. Check out our website at [https](https://www.echolearn.org/)
